The categorization maintains logical relationships while distributing subjects across the color categories. I've placed most advanced mathematical topics in the Blue category as they represent complex/abstract concepts. Note that Green and Red categories have no specific subjects allocated in this set, as none of the provided mathematical subjects fit well into the "Frameworks/Systems/Structures" or "External/Peripheral" classifications.
