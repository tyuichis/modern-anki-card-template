# Color Explanations:

## Purple (Fundamentals/Core Concepts):
Topics like "atomic structure," "periodic table," "states of matter," and "mole concept" provide foundational knowledge that is essential for understanding chemistry as a whole. These are core principles that set the stage for more complex concepts.

## Turquoise (Mechanics/Tools/Syntax):
Subjects related to practical methods and techniques in chemistry, like "chemical bonding," "stoichiometry," "gas laws," "pH calculations," "molar mass," "limiting reactants," and "empirical formulas," involve learning specific rules, formulas, and methods used in chemical analysis and calculations.

## Pink (Application/Practice/Examples):
Topics such as "chemical reactions," "solutions," "organic chemistry reactions," "polymers," "titrations," "solubility," and "colligative properties" involve applying core principles in real-world scenarios, helping to illustrate how the concepts are used in practice.

## Blue (Advanced/Complex/Abstract):
More complex or abstract concepts such as "chemical kinetics," "chemical equilibrium," "thermochemistry," "nuclear chemistry," "electrochemistry," "radioactive decay," "rate laws," "activation energy," "enthalpy," "entropy," and "Gibbs free energy" require higher-level understanding and are often discussed in advanced studies.

## Green (Frameworks/Systems/Structures):
Topics like "spectroscopy," "intermolecular forces," "buffers," "isotopes," and "oxidation states" fit into the broader systems or frameworks within chemistry that explain how different reactions and properties fit together within chemical structures and systems.
