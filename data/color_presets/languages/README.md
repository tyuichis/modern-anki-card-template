The categorization distributes language learning subjects across the color categories while maintaining logical relationships. I've allocated most subjects to the Purple (fundamentals), Turquoise (mechanics), Pink (applications), Blue (advanced concepts), and Orange (variations) categories to reflect their natural roles in language learning. The Green category (frameworks) has fewer subjects since most structural aspects of language are already covered in other categories. The Red category (external/peripheral) has no allocations as all the provided subjects are central to language learning rather than peripheral.
