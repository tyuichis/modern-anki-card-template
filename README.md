## About  
A modern, streamlined Anki template that enhances the default cards (**Front/Back, Cloze**) with better usability and design.  

It introduces new fields‚Äî**Topic, Subtopic, Source,** and **Details**‚Äîto help organize your cards more effectively.  

Common actions like **Undo** and **Flag** are also now built into the card interface, along with a **progress bar** for better tracking on Desktop.  

While many templates exist, few focus on a **native, built-in UI/UX experience**. This template bridges that gap.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the Card Types üÉè  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Download** the `.apkg` file from the Releases page.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Open the `.apkg` file & Import** the two card types using "Import Note Type":  
   - **Q&A**  
   - **Cloze**  

---

### Step 2: Install Required Add-ons üîß  
To unlock all essential features, **install these add-ons via Anki's add-on menu**:  

```
1230570706 1490471827
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> üö® **These add-ons are required for full functionality on Desktop:**  
>  
> - üîÑ **Undo & Flag Status Buttons** ‚Üí Requires **UI Status Buttons** `1230570706` add-on.  
> - üìä **Remaining Cards & Progress Bar** ‚Üí Requires **Anki JavaScript API** `1490471827` add-on.  

---

### Step 3 (Optional): Enable Code Syntax Highlighting üíª  
> [!NOTE]
> If you do not need to use code, skip this step.

By default, syntax highlighting is **disabled** to maximize performance.
To enable it:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Add these files** to your Anki `collection.media` folder:  
   - `_highlight.min.js`  
   - `_github-dark.min.css`  
   - **All files inside** `languages/`  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Modify your card templates:**  
   - Find `syntaxHighlighting = false`  
   - Change it to `syntaxHighlighting = true`  
   - Apply this to the Front & Back sides of the templates you want to use  

üìñ **For help finding the correct folder path, see** [Anki Docs](https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations).  

---

### ‚úÖ That's it! You're all set! üéâ  
Now you can start using the deck with full functionality.  

### Useful extras

We've also curated 3 extra add-ons that make it extremely convenient to make cards.

- Editor Live Preview `1960039667`
- Field AutoComplete `511710206` 
- Markdown support for code blocks and inline code `1844938046`

If you _had_ to get an extra add-on, get **Editor Live Preview**. This visualises the cards you're making before committing.

To get all the extras, copy and paste this into your Anki Add-on menu:

```
511710206 1844938046 1960039667
```


## Add-on dependencies

### 1. UI Status Buttons
addon: `1230570706`

To use the UI buttons (Undo, Flag buttons) on Desktop, you'll need to download the add-on either from AnkiWeb, or within the Releases page.

### 2. Anki JavaScript API
addon: `1490471827` 

This is also a necessary add-on if you want to see how many remaining cards are in your deck during Card Review.

### 3. Editor Live Preview
addon: `1960039667` 

**This is the most recommended third-party addon.**

This card template was specially designed to reduce visual clutter and focus on the [Rule of Minimum Information](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge#:~:text=cost%20you%20dearly!-,Stick%20to%20the%C2%A0minimum%20information%20principle,-The%20material%20you)[^2][^3]. When the container looks full, it's a good sign there's too much information in the card. The Live Preview helps you work with the design of the templates and structure your flashcard contents.

### 4. Field AutoComplete
addon: `511710206` 

If you find yourself often creating cards for the same topic, this is a lifesaver.

Used alongside the native pin function, you save 1+ minute per card.

### 5. Markdown support for code blocks and inline code
addon: `1844938046` 

If you need to use code blocks repeatedly, get this. 

It enables you to use double ticks for inline-code, `, and triple ticks for multi-line code blocks ts  with optional language support, i.e. ts for typescript, rs for rust, etc.

Note: You'll need to write your code blocks within the [HTML editor of Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#:~:text=The%20%3C/%3E%20button%20allows%20editing%20the%20underlying%20HTML%20of%20a%20field.) (click the <> button in the Card Field to expand).

As of March 4 2025, `<>` tags are not supported while writing code blocks using this extension. 

## Usage

There are new fields to use:

| Fields                   |
|--------------------------|
| ‚ú® **Topic** üìå              |
| ‚ú® **Subtopic**  üìå         |
| Question                 |
| Answer                   |
| ‚ú® **Source (optional)** üìå |
| ‚ú® **Details (optional)** |

**Topic** represents the general thing you're studying, i.e. Vocabulary, Biology...

**Subtopic** represents a specific part of your topic, i.e. Colors, Plants...

**Source (optional)** allows you to cite a source,  usually your textbook or a URL

**Details (optional)** are any extra information that can help remember the card.

> [!TIP]
> By using Anki's built-in **pinned fields**üìå feature, you can efficiently create multiple flashcards for a topic and subtopic while keeping track of sources and context.
> 
> This is extremely useful if you were reading a chapter and needed to make flashcards for the same chapter.

Topic and Subtopic are flexible. The scope of **topics and subtopics** can expand or contract depending on how broadly or narrowly you define them.

Here‚Äôs a general hierarchy to illustrate:

1. **Genetics** (Broad Topic)  
   - **DNA** (Subtopic under Genetics)  
     - **mRNA** (Subtopic under DNA)  
       - **Transcription** (More specific subtopic under mRNA)

In Anki, this could be:  

| ‚ú® **Topic**    | **Genetics**  |
|----------|------|
| ‚ú® **Subtopic** | **DNA** |

or

| ‚ú® **Topic**    | **DNA**  |
|----------|------|
| ‚ú® **Subtopic** | **mRNA** |

The depth of the hierarchy depends on **how detailed you want to go** and what level of learning you're aiming for (e.g., high school, college, research).  

## FAQ
<details>
<summary> <b>Code highlighting doesn't seem to work</b></summary>
  
Be sure to add `_highlight.min.js`, `_github-dark.min.css` and all the files in `languages/` to your Anki's collection.media folder, then set syntaxHighlighting = true in your card templates.

For a visual guide on enabling syntax highlighting, check out the [Wiki page](https://github.com/tyuichis/modern-anki-card-template/wiki/Enabling-Syntax-Highlighting).
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What if I want to go back to my old template?</b></summary>
  
  Good news, these templates are backwards compatible. 
  
  In the browser menu, you can click a card and right click the "Change Note Type" option.

  The template fields map 1:1 with the original Anki cards, i.e. Front = Question, Back = Answer, and Cloze text = Cloze text.

> 
> If you have more than "Front" and "Back" fields, be careful. You will lose data if you don't select all the fields.
> Make a copy of your card first, then change the Note Type to test.

[^1]: The card template is already coded to use highlight.js if available. Please put `_highlight.min.js` `_github-dark.min.css` and all the `languages/ files` to your Anki's `collection.media` folder, then set `syntaxHighlighting = true` in your card templates. Restart Anki to use.
[^2]: The flashcard text content has a container to help immediately focus on the information. The flashcard is also positioned such that the contents are where your eyes typically are, slightly above center.
[^3]: Metadata is still important to embed in a flashcard. For example, **sources** give reminders on where you learnt your knowledge and the memory associated with learning it.
